1. Error response handling: Ensure graceful handling of errors or malformed responses from the origin server to prevent proxy crashes or undefined behavior.
2. Limited HTTP method support: Explicitly check and return a 501 Not Implemented response to clients for unsupported HTTP methods, maintaining proxy stability and expected behavior.
3. Error handling and thread management: Use structured exception handling within threads to ensure safe interruption and cleanup in the event of exceptions or unexpected termination, preserving the overall operation of the proxy.
4. Sensitive information in logs: Implement filtering or redaction techniques in the logging mechanism to prevent logging sensitive information, with a recommendation to support HTTPS for enhanced data encryption.
5. Handling unusual server responses: Design the proxy to correctly handle all valid HTTP status codes, including logging and forwarding server responses unchanged to the client.
6. Cache eviction policy: Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar cache eviction strategy to remove old cache entries when exceeding cache capacity, ensuring efficient cache storage management.
7. Cache validation and expiration: Treat cache entries without max_age or with max_age set to 0 as needing revalidation with the origin server, implementing mechanisms for cache freshness checks and updates based on HTTP headers.
8. Dynamic cache entry types: Monitor changes in caching directives in each response and dynamically update the caching strategy for each URL, including removing entries from the cache when they are set to no-store.
